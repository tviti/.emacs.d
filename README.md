## .emacs.d

A git repo to track my emacs config, and simplify installation/synchronization
across multiple machines.

Note that my local `.emacs.d directory` and `init.el` on my laptop have probably
accumulated some cruft over the years (this probably still has crap from when I
was an undergraduate running a `matlab` interpreter remotely over `tramp`, and
trying to synchronize an `org-mode` calendar with an `iCal` calendar with a
google calendar...), and so could probably stand to be cleaned up a little (one
of these days...)
